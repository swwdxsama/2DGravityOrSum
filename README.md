# 2DGrav

# This is a personal project in which I will try to write a tiny simulation for gravity between two objects (possibly more, I'm thinking about adding scalability and GUI) in C/C++ using SDL3 for 2d graphics

# Update 1: added scalability to engine. Started working on GUI

# Update 2: didn't do anything special. GUI postponed 'till i feel like it. Maybe a text UI is on the way. UGHHHH I DON'T KNWO
